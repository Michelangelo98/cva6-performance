Dear ...,

I am writing to recommend Michelangelo Miceli for any job opportunities in the field of digital
design. Michelangelo is currently completing his Master's degree in Electronic Engineering at 
Politecnico Di Torino, and I have had the pleasure of working with him as his professor supervisor 
during his Master's Thesis at ETH Zurich.

I am impressed with his skills and qualifications in digital design. During his time at 
ETH Zurich, Michelangelo demonstrated his ability to develop a digital design project from 
algorithm research to hardware description, verification, and benchmarking. Specifically, 
Michelangelo has been working on implementing a cache coherence algorithm for CVA6, a RISC-V 
based processor developed at ETH, and has been providing me with weekly progress reports. His 
dedication, passion, and hard work are evident in his work.

Michelangelo is a highly motivated individual who consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic 
and respect for deadlines. His passion for digital design and computer architecture is evident in
his work, and I have no doubt that he will excel in any digital design project he undertakes.

Overall, I highly recommend Michelangelo for any digital design job opportunities. His skills, 
qualifications, and passion for digital design make him a proper candidate for any position.

Sincerely,
...
